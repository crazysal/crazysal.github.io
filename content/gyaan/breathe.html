          <p><em>This is one of the most powerful pieces in recent times that has had a tremendous affect on me, the way I function and my though process in general. I wanted to keep a record to be able to read it whenever I feel down, depressed , in a flux of random mood swings where you spend days regretting the work you should be doing but just can not shake of that stupor.</em></p>

          <p>Breathe. It&rsquo;s okay. You&rsquo;re going to be okay. Just breathe. Breathe, and remind yourself of all the times in the past you felt this scared. All of the times you felt this anxious and this overwhelmed. All of the times you felt this level of pain. And remind yourself how each time, you made it through. Life has thrown so much at you, and despite how difficult things have been, you&rsquo;ve survived. Breathe and trust that you can survive this too. Trust that this struggle is part of the process. And trust that as long as you don&rsquo;t give up and keep pushing forward, no matter how hopeless things seem, you will make it.<br /> Don&rsquo;t allow the negative things in your life to discount the positive ones. Don&rsquo;t let a bad day or month or year make you feel like you have a bad life. Instead of focusing on everything that&rsquo;s going wrong, start holding onto all of the things that are going right. You may be struggling, but there is still so much to keep fighting for &mdash; there is still so much more to life than this pain. And if you keep picking yourself back up and pushing forward, no matter how difficult things are, you will discover it. Maybe not tomorrow or next week or a year from now, but someday soon, things will get better. Someday soon, you will find freedom from this darkness. And when you do, you&rsquo;ll look back on these days and wonder how you could have doubted your resilience. You&rsquo;ll look back and marvel at how something as small as refusing to give up could transform your life in such a substantial way.<br /> You don&rsquo;t have to be what other people want you to be. You don&rsquo;t have to be interesting or agreeable or entertaining. You don&rsquo;t have to tone yourself down, quiet your voice, or hide your feelings. You don&rsquo;t have to be outgoing or spontaneous or sociable. You don&rsquo;t have to be thin or beautiful or anyone&rsquo;s definition of attractive. You don&rsquo;t have to be anyone other than who you authentically are, and you sure as hell don&rsquo;t have to spend your time and energy trying to convince people that you&rsquo;re worth keeping around. The right people are going to recognize your worth. They are going to respect you, appreciate you, and accept you, without forcing you to compromise who you are. Life is too short, and your happiness is far too important, to make room for anyone who treats you otherwise.<br /> You don&rsquo;t ever have to apologize for feeling sad. You aren&rsquo;t being too sensitive. You aren&rsquo;t imagining things or being overdramatic. You&rsquo;re being true to yourself by honoring your emotions, and that is never something you have to feel ashamed of. Whether you have a need that isn&rsquo;t being met, an old wound that&rsquo;s been reopened, a person in your life who is making you feel small, a painful memory of something from the past, or an emptiness from the loss of someone you care about &mdash; there is always something underlying our sadness, and whatever it is, it&rsquo;s important and valid. Whatever it is, it deserves to be expressed and felt.<br /> Being strong doesn&rsquo;t mean hiding your pain. It doesn&rsquo;t mean forgoing help when you&rsquo;re struggling. It doesn&rsquo;t mean denying yourself things that feel good for the sake of practicing self-control. It doesn&rsquo;t mean refusing to show sadness and vulnerability. And it doesn&rsquo;t mean carrying the burdens of life all by yourself. Anything that prevents your healing and stifles your growth does not correspond with strength. Being strong means refusing to tolerate people and things that wound your soul. It means practicing self-care when you&rsquo;re hurting. It means honoring your feelings by actually allowing yourself to feel and express them. It means treating yourself with compassion and kindness, even when you feel like you don&rsquo;t deserve any. It means doing what makes you happy and being with people who make you feel good, regardless of outside judgements. It means asking for help when the weight of the world has become too much. It means giving yourself permission to get your needs met by setting boundaries and using your voice. It means forgiving yourself on the days that you&rsquo;re struggling and can&rsquo;t be brave. It means challenging the voice telling you that you&rsquo;re inadequate and worthless and reminding yourself, repeatedly, that you are enough.<br /> If you&rsquo;re struggling, you deserve to make self-care a priority. Whether that means lying in bed all day, eating comfort food, putting off homework, crying, sleeping, rescheduling plans, finding an escape through a good book, watching your favorite tv show, or doing nothing at all &mdash; give yourself permission to put your healing first. Quiet the voice telling you to do more and be more, and today, whatever you do, let it be enough. Feel your feelings, breathe, and be gentle with yourself. Acknowledge that you&rsquo;re doing the best you can to cope and survive. And trust that during this time of struggle, it&rsquo;s enough.</p>
