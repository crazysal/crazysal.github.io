            <p>Things To Do:So where did I go wrong with my life?You know when one starts doubting his own decisions. Remorse. It just eats away your soul. It is actually the worst feeling one can feel, it's better being wrong, being hated. But when you are just lost without any feeling,a sense of confusion surrounding you that is when it really starts to suck.I&rsquo;m tired. Tired of being lost in life. Everywhere I turn I see people looking for directions,searching for answers to questions that do not exist. You hand them a roadmap and believe me they&rsquo;ll be just as happy to follow it to the dot. Even if anything goes wrong,it is not their fault so it hardly matters. But when you start taking your own decisions and then regretting them, you get screwed. Real freaking screwed.For the past few weeks, I have hardly slept more than a few hours. And even I&rsquo;m surprised but I&rsquo;ve been fully conscious. No cigarettes, no. Nothing.And I came to realize that the shit that&rsquo;s been going around in my head is really shit. Nobody, no fucking body cares or understands anything that is happening to all of us. I&rsquo;m not claiming to be any psychic shit I&rsquo;m just as ignorant as anyone,maybe even more. This hallucination of a life we have. Never really comprehending why we were put here to what purpose? Just staying muddled up in our mere mortal issues never even thinking about the higher purpose of life.I know right now all that you cannot comprehend is,what the fuck is this piece of writing. But just for a moment stop thinking. STOP. Open your mind and concentrate on the sole question of what is the reason behind your existence. Why do you live?What is it that we aim for that we have to keep going through such a crap each and every day?And please do not come up with &lsquo;eternal happiness&rsquo; or &lsquo;love of my life&rsquo;. Or I will be the first person to shoot you and throw your remains in the pacific. Try to take that path less traveled. What&rsquo;s worth the price is always worth the fight, Shit am I preaching? Fuck me. Guess it was meant more as a to-do note for myself. <br /> So here goes:</p>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li> <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-h">  Never fall in Love, or even expect to.</i></li>
                <li><i class="fa fa-ellipsis-h">  Forget the wrong you have done, the people you have hurt, the expectations you have failed just leave behind reasons to be missed.</i></li>
                <li><i class="fa fa-ellipsis-h">  No one else will come and save you, especially from yourself.&#61623;You will never be alone, there will always someone by your side promising to bring the world down.</i></li>
                <li><i class="fa fa-ellipsis-h">  Breathe, Relax. Always. Forever.</i></li>
                <li><i class="fa fa-ellipsis-h">  Stop dreaming so much, expecting so much , In relative terms start appreciating what you have, supposedly even shit is supposed to have a silver lining.</i></li>               
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p> Friends, lovers, family, at the point when you&rsquo;re neck-deep in shit none of them will be there, that&rsquo;s a life&rsquo;s rule so stop blaming them for your mistakes.<br /> 

             <h3> Stop asking stupid questions to strangers</h3></p>
