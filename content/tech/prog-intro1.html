              <p>Even the smallest task we carry out in our daily lives is biologically <strong>programmed in our brain neurons</strong>. If I want to lift a glass I do not sit and calculate the tensile strength of the glass, the tension on its surface, the friction between the fingers, the amount of force required or the angle of elevation etc. I just pick up the glass. This is possible because of the <strong>default programming</strong> that provides all this above information and takes care of the <strong>background processing</strong>.</p>
              <p>In short <strong>programming is a way of life</strong>.</p>
              <p>In explicit technical terms a<strong> program</strong> is a set of written instructions that is processed as a standard input on a machine to carry out the desired output.</p>
              <p>Before we see what a computer programming language looks like, let&#8217;s use the English language to describe how to do something as a series of steps. A common exercise that really gets you thinking about what <strong>computer programming</strong> can be like is to describe a process you are familiar with.</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>Describe how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Rather than write my own version of this exercise, I searched the Internet for the words &#8220;computer programming sandwich&#8221; using <a href="http://www.google.com/"><strong>Google</strong></a>. One of the hits returned was <a href="http://teachers.net/lessons/posts/2166.html"><strong>http://teachers.net/lessons/posts/2166.html</strong></a>. At the link, Deb Sweeney (Tamaqua Area Middle School, Tamaqua, PA) described the problem as:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p> <strong>Objective:</strong></p>
                <p>Students will write specific and sequential steps on how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
                <p>Students will write a very detailed and step-by-step</p>
                <p>paragraph on how to make a peanut butter and jelly</p>
                <p>sandwich for homework. The next day, the students will</p>
                <p>then input (read) their instructions to the computer</p>
                <p>(teacher). The teacher will then &#8220;make&#8221; the programs,</p>
                <p>being sure to do exactly what the students said&#8230;</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>When this exercise is directed by an experienced teacher it is excellent for demonstrating how careful you need to be, how detailed you need to be, when writing a computer program. </p>
              <p>Programming in a natural language, say the full scope of the English language, seems like a very difficult task.</p>
