I am one of those free spirits of this world who is never conformed to boundaries, for INTPers like me&ndash;&ldquo;The Thinkers&rdquo;&ndash; we represent just 3% of the population. 

Eloquently as Albert Einstein put it, 
>"Problems cannot be solved at the same level of awareness that created them". 

*I have this innate need to be always on the search for not only new solutions to old problems but new problems to solve.*

Currently I am pursuing my Master's Degree in Computer Science from the State University at Buffalo, New York.  

I am also working as a research internn @ [Ericssom Research](https://www.ericsson.com/en/tech-innovation) since Summer 2018. My main focus of research is topics in Computer vision and Deep Learning. I am currently working on improving the throughput of segmentation tasks as even though world class algorithms can do object detection @30-40fps they start to lag when given the cumbersome task of classifying each pixel in an image to a particular class and the state of the art work by guy's over at [Fair : MrcNN, is at a measely 3-4fps](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron). 

I was previously employed as a Sofware Engineer @[FAASOS](https://www.faasos.com/about), with 2.5 years of experience as a software engineer I dreamt (literally) about building scalable machine learning solutions for everyday tasks and was fondly called as the internal faasos stackoverflow by my dev team.

Previously employed as a Full Stack Developer @ [Jugnoo](https://www.jugnoo.in/), providing dynamic web-based solutions for their on demand hyperlocal services.

All things technology hold a strong sense of affinity for me. Developing algorithms from ground up unit mechanics is a favorite pastime. I keep moving   forward as many other AI researchers with the hopes of besting the Turing test one day.
